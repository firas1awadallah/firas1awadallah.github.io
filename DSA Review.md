## Reading Questions
1. What are the key pieces of advice mentioned in the “Whiteboard Advice” reading assignment for successfully tackling whiteboard interviews?
* The best piece of technical interview advice I have received and can impart upon you is to communicate, communicate, communicate! This may seem like an anti-climactic piece of advice, but I hope to be able to demonstrate to you that it’s actually the most important skill to prepare prior to an interview.

2. From the “6 tips to ace a whiteboard programming interview” article, can you identify and explain at least two strategies that can help improve your performance during a whiteboard programming interview?
* Take a few minutes.
Speaking as an interview coach, this is one misstep that I see all the time during mock interviews. The canonical tip that everyone gives is, “talk more!”. What most of those well-meaning advice-givers overlook, however, is that talking and thinking at the same time is extremely hard. Nervous interviewees will jump straight into talking, passing up a great opportunity for concentrated thought.
* Write down the steps of the solution.
Even after you have an idea of how to attack the problem, don’t start writing code down. Write down the general steps of how you will solve it on one side of the whiteboard, where it’s visible but won’t get in the way. You don’t need to be verbose, just get the steps in order and somewhat readable.
* Write pseudocode first.
Time to write code? Nope. Take a “dry run” at writing the code by writing some pseudocode. Often we run into problems halfway through writing the code, and there’s no point wasting time over syntax when you might have to throw the code away. Instead, write some half-baked code-looking stuff that lays out the structure of how your code will work. Do it over on the side of the whiteboard, so you have space left to work.
* Don’t sweat the small stuff.
Programming interviews are not about how well you’ve remembered your semicolons, nor are they about being able to remember all of the flags on a TCP packet. They’re about demonstrating depth and breadth of knowledge, personality strengths, and problem-solving abilities. If you make a mistake, it’s okay. Brush it off and move on.
* Come prepared.
When it comes to programming interviews, there is no substitute for HOBIS (which stands for Hours of Butt-In-Seat). If you want to be ready, you have to put in the time. It’s important in order to maximize your chances of acing the interview, but it’s also important for your peace of mind during the interview and afterwards. In the interview, knowing that you’ve done all you can to prepare helps you stay calm and cool, and increases your chances of success. And afterwards, regardless of the outcome, knowing that you could not have reasonably done more to prepare helps you feel proud of your work and start moving towards your next goal.
6) Review your work.
You won’t always finish questions in the time permitted, but occasionally you’ll have extra time after coming up with a solution. If this happens, it’s tempting to say “Well, I’m done!”. Interviews are stressful and we want them to be over as fast as possible. This is reasonable, but.

3. What does Gayle McDowell say about interview preparation in the Engineering Interview Process Deconstructed video?

* Technical Knowledge: Brush up on fundamental concepts related to your field of engineering, such as data structures, algorithms, system design, coding languages, and relevant technologies.

* Problem-Solving Skills: Practice solving engineering-related problems to improve your critical thinking, analytical abilities, and approach to complex challenges.

* Interviews: Conduct mock interviews with friends, colleagues, or through online platforms to simulate the interview experience and receive feedback on your performance.

* Resume Review: Ensure that your resume highlights relevant skills, experiences, and projects related to the engineering role you are applying for.

* Behavioral Interviews: Prepare for behavioral questions by thinking about examples from your past experiences that demonstrate teamwork, leadership, problem-solving, and other relevant skills.

* Research the Company: Understand the company's products, culture, and values to tailor your answers during the interview and show genuine interest in the organization.

* Ask Questions: Prepare thoughtful questions to ask the interviewer about the company, team, projects, or the role itself to demonstrate your engagement and interest.

* Stay Calm and Confident: On the day of the interview, try to remain composed, maintain good body language, and exhibit confidence in your abilities.
