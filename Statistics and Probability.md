# Statistics and Probability

## What is probability?
At the most basic level, probability seeks to answer the question, "What is the chance of an event happening?" An event is some outcome of interest. To calculate the chance of an event happening, we also need to consider all the other events that can occur. The quintessential representation of probability is the humble coin toss. In a coin toss the only events that can happen are:

* Flipping a heads
* Flipping a tails

These two events form the sample space, the set of all possible events that can happen. To calculate the probability of an event occurring, we count how many times are event of interest can occur (say flipping heads) and dividing it by the sample space. Thus, probability will tell us that an ideal coin will have a 1-in-2 chance of being heads or tails. 

## From statistics to probability
Our data will be generated by flipping a coin 10 times and counting how many times we get heads. We will call a set of 10 coin tosses a trial. Our data point will be the number of heads we observe. We may not get the "ideal" 5 heads, but we won't worry too much since one trial is only one data point. If we perform many, many trials, we expect the average number of heads over all of our trials to approach the 50%. The code below simulates 10, 100, 1000, and 1000000 trials, and then calculates the average proportion of heads observed. 


* the data confirm that our average number of heads does approach what probability suggests it should be. Furthermore, this average improves with more trials. In 10 trials, there's some slight error, but this error almost disappears entirely with 1,000,000 trials. As we get more trials, the deviation away from the average decreases. Sound familiar? Sure, we could have flipped the coin ourselves, but Python saves us a lot of time by allowing us to model this process in code. As we get more and more data, the real-world starts to resemble the ideal.



* What is the chance of someone developing a disease over time? What is the probability that a critical car component will fail when you are driving? There are no easy ways to calculate probabilities, so we must fall back on using data and statistics to calculate them. Given more and more data, we can become more confident that what we calculate represents the true probability of these important events happening. 

## The data and the distribution
* The most important qualities to notice about the normal distribution is its symmetry and its shape. We've been calling it a distribution, but what exactly is being distributed? It depends on the context. In probability, the normal distribution is a particular distribution of the probability across all of the events. The x-axis takes on the values of events we want to know the probability of. The y-axis is the probability associated with each event, from 0 to 1.


* In a probability context, the high point in a normal distribution represents the event with the highest probability of occurring. As you get farther away from this event on either side, the probability drops rapidly, forming that familiar bell-shape. The high point in a statistical context actually represents the mean. As in probability, as you get farther from the mean, you rapidly drop off in frequency. That is to say, extremely high and low deviations from the mean are present but exceedingly rare.

## Revisiting the normal

1. Central Limit Theorem
 we demonstrated that if we repeated our 10-toss trials many, many times, the average heads-count of all of these trials will approach the 50% we expect from an ideal coin. With more trials, the closer the average of these trials approach the true probability, even if the individual trials themselves are imperfect. This idea is a key tenet of the Central Limit Theorem. In our coin-tossing example, a single trial of 10 throws produces a single estimate of what probability suggests should happen (5 heads). We call it an estimate because we know that it won't be perfect (i.e. we won't get 5 heads every time).

If we make many estimates, the Central Limit Theorem dictates that the distribution of these estimates will look like a normal distribution. The zenith of this distribution will line up with the true value that the estimates should take on. In statistics, the peak of the normal distribution lines up with the mean, and that's exactly what we observed. Thus, given multiple "trials" as our data, the Central Limit Theorem suggests that we can hone in on the theoretical ideal given by probability, even when we don't know the true probability. Central Limit Theorem lets us know that the average of many trials means will approach the true mean, the Three Sigma Rule will tell us how much the data will be spread out around this mean.

2. Three Sigma Rule
The Three Sigma rule, also known as the empirical rule or 68-95-99.7 rule, is an expression of how many of our observations fall within a certain distance of the mean. Remember that the standard deviation (a.k.a. "sigma") is the average distance an observation in the data set is from the mean. The Three Sigma rule dictates that given a normal distribution, 68% of your observations will fall between one standard deviation of the mean. 95% will fall within two, and 99.7% will fall within three. A lot of complicated math goes into the derivation of these values, and as such, is out of the scope of this article. The key takeaway is to know that the Three Sigma Rule enables us to know how much data is contained under different intervals of a normal distribution. The picture below is a great summary of what the Three Sigma Rule represents. Three Sigma

3. Z-score
The Z-score is a simple calculation that answers the question, "Given a data point, how many standard deviations is it away from the mean?" The equation below is the Z-score equation. Z-score

By itself, the Z-score doesn't provide much information to you. It gains the most value when compared against a Z-table, which tabulates the cumulative probability of a standard normal distribution up until a given Z-score. A standard normal is a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The Z-score lets us reference this the Z-table even if our normal distribution is not standard. The cumulative probability is the sum of the probabilities of all values occurring, up until a given point.

## Reading Questions
1. What is the purpose of dunder methods in Python? Provide an example of a commonly used dunder method.
Dunder methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, are special functions in Python that provide a way to define behaviors for objects that are built into the language. These methods are denoted by double underscores (also called "dunder" for short) at the beginning and end of their names.

The purpose of dunder methods is to enable operator overloading and to provide a consistent interface for interacting with objects of a particular class. By implementing these methods, you can define how objects respond to various operations such as arithmetic operations, comparisons, and conversions.


2. In the video “AI Guru makes $238,800 with misleading paid course,” what was the main ethical issue raised concerning the use of developers’ work, and how might this have been avoided?
One of the main ethical issues concerning the use of developers' work is the issue of intellectual property rights and fair compensation..

To avoid this ethical issue, 

* Clear contractual agreements: Developers should have clear and comprehensive contracts with the organizations they work for or the clients they provide services to.

* Open-source licensing: If developers choose to release their work under an open-source license, they can define the terms of use and distribution for their code.

* Collaboration and acknowledgment: When developers contribute to open-source projects or collaborate with others, it is important to acknowledge their work appropriately. 

3. Describe the Python statistics module and give an example of a function within the module that can be used to perform a common statistical operation.

The Python statistics module is a built-in module that provides functions for performing various statistical operations on data. It offers a wide range of statistical functions, making it convenient for tasks such as calculating measures of central tendency, dispersion, correlation, and more.
