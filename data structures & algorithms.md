# Data Structures and Algorithm
data structures and algorithms is important in programming because 

1. Efficiency: Data structures and algorithms help to optimize program performance

2. Reusability: Data structures and algorithms are reusable components that can be applied to many different programming problems.

3. Scalability: As programs grow in size and complexity, data structures and algorithms become even more important

4. Maintainability: Well-designed data structures and algorithms make it easier to maintain and update code
## Algorithm :
An algorithm is a set of instructions or a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or performing a specific task.
Algorithms are used in a wide range of applications, from software development and computer science to mathematics, engineering, and other fields

## Big O: 
Big O  is a way of expressing the complexity of an algorithm or function, in terms of the input size. It describes the upper bound of the growth rate of a function, as the input size approaches infinity

## Type of data structures

1. Arrays

An array is a structure of fixed-size, which can hold items of the same data type. It can be an array of integers, an array of floating-point numbers, an array of strings or even an array of arrays

2. Linked Lists

 linked list is a sequential structure that consists of a sequence of items in linear order which are linked to each other.

3. Stacks

A stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out — the element placed at last can be accessed at first) structure which can be commonly found in many programming languages. 

4. Queues

A queue is a FIFO (First In First Out — the element placed at first can be accessed at first) structure which can be commonly found in many programming languages.

5. Trees

A tree is a hierarchical structure where data is organized hierarchically and are linked together. This structure is different from a linked list whereas, in a linked list, items are linked in a linear order.

## Discussion Questions Answers

1. One important thing to consider when choosing a data structure to solve a problem is the time and space complexity of the available options. Different data structures have different strengths and weaknesses in terms of their performance characteristics for different operations, such as searching, inserting, deleting, and accessing elements.

2. To avoid an infinite recursive call stack, you need to make sure that your recursive function has a proper termination condition. This means that the function should stop calling itself when it reaches a certain point or condition
