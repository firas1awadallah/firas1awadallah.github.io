# Serverless Functions
## Reading Questions
1. What are the key characteristics of serverless computing, and how does it differ from traditional server-based architectures?
 
- No server management: Serverless computing abstracts away the underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on writing code without worrying about server provisioning, scaling, or maintenance.
- Event-driven architecture: Serverless functions are triggered by specific events or requests, such as HTTP requests, database changes, or timer-based triggers. The function executes only when triggered, reducing costs and resource wastage.
- Automatic scaling: Serverless platforms automatically scale the functions based on the incoming workload. They allocate resources as needed, ensuring optimal performance and cost-efficiency.
- Pay-per-use pricing: With serverless, you are billed based on the actual execution time and resources used by your functions. You don't pay for idle time or provisioned capacity.

Differences from traditional server-based architectures:
- In serverless computing, developers focus on writing functions or microservices rather than managing servers.
- Serverless functions are stateless and ephemeral, designed to handle individual tasks or events.
- Serverless computing offers automatic scaling and high availability without the need for manual configuration or provisioning.
- Traditional server-based architectures require more management and upfront capacity planning.

2. How can one get started with Vercel, and what are the main steps involved in deploying a serverless function using Vercel?
 Getting started with Vercel and deploying a serverless function:
To get started with Vercel and deploy a serverless function, follow these steps:

Step 1: Install Vercel CLI
- Install the Vercel CLI by running `npm install -g vercel` in your command-line interface.

Step 2: Create a project
- Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it.
- Initialize a new project using `vercel init`.

Step 3: Write your serverless function
- Create a new file, e.g., `api/my-function.js`, and write your serverless function in it. You can use Node.js or other supported languages.
- Export a function from the file to define the serverless endpoint.

Step 4: Deploy to Vercel
- In the project directory, run `vercel` to deploy your project.
- Vercel will guide you through the deployment process, including creating a new project or linking to an existing one.
- Choose the appropriate settings for your project during the deployment process.

Step 5: Test and use your serverless function
- Once the deployment is complete, Vercel will provide you with a URL for your serverless function.
- You can test the function by sending requests to the provided URL.

3. What are APIs, and how can they be utilized in Python applications to access and manipulate data from external sources?
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):
- APIs define a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and interact with each other.
- APIs provide a way to access and manipulate data or functionality from external sources or services.
- They enable developers to integrate third-party services, retrieve data, perform actions, and automate tasks within their applications.

Utilizing APIs in Python applications:
- Python provides libraries and frameworks to interact with APIs, making it easy to consume and process data from external sources.
- Developers can use the Requests library to send HTTP requests to APIs and handle the responses.
- Python's built-in JSON or third-party libraries can parse the API responses and extract relevant data.

4. What is the Requests library in Python, and how can it be used to interact with APIs by sending HTTP requests? Can you provide an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library?


The Requests library in Python:
- The Requests library is a popular Python library for making HTTP requests and interacting with APIs.
- It simplifies the process of sending HTTP requests, handling responses, and managing various aspects of network communication.
